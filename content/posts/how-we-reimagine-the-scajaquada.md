As you may have heard, a public discussion of the fate of the 198 has been reignited with the release of a set of proposals by the Greater Buffalo Niagara Regional Transportation Council (GBNRTC).  As this work has occurred, the Design Committee of the Scajaquada Corridor Coalition (SCC) has followed a parallel path to come up with [a set of proposals](https://www.gbnrtc.org/regioncentral-events) to also serve as a blueprint for the future.

With multiple goals: including reuniting the separated sections of Delaware Park, re-energizing the communities at the eastern end of the roadway, allowing Buffalo State to become a waterfront campus, helping Waterkeeper to reclaim Scajaquada Creek as a usable waterway and promoting economic development at the western end of the corridor, the SCC has released its plans.  **Please view these as a way to compare and comment on what the Greater Buffalo Niagara Regional Transportation Commission (GBNRTC ) has proposed.**

We urge you to review each of [the four proposals advanced by the GBNRTC](https://www.gbnrtc.org/regioncentral-events).  They provide a thoughtful set of options from which to select the individual pieces which may ultimately become the redesign of the 198.  **The deadline for commenting on the proposals is quickly approaching on May 22 and your input is important.** [Please share your comments with GBNRTC](https://www.gbnrtc.org/regioncentral-comment).

Please share this on your social media platforms and with your network! This is a generational project whose impact will be felt long after we are gone. So, we ask you to do your part for yourself and for your children and grandchildren to ensure a positive conclusion to this discussion.  Remember â€“ We are Buffalo and we deserve it.
